# Pusher WebRTC Chat Demo

## Servers

### Node.js

### PHP

### Ruby (Sinatra)

## Security

It's worth noting that the default __PHP server setup__ in this demo will potentially leave the demo config files for other platforms open to being read. It's highly recommended to implement strict control over which files can be read from your server, or moving the server files into a directory outside of public reach.

_When using this demo in your own production environment, you should remove the servers you don't need and ensure that config files aren't readable to the public._
